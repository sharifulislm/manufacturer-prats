<p>
Internally, React uses several clever techniques to minimize the number of costly DOM operations required to update the UI. While this will lead to a faster user interface without specifically optimizing for performance for many cases, there are ways where you can still speed up your React application. This post will go over some useful techniques you can use to improve your React code.</p>

                <p>Simply put, prototypical inheritance refers to the ability to access object properties from another object. We use a JavaScript prototype to add new properties and methods to an existing object constructor. We can then essentially tell our JS code to inherit properties from a prototype. </p>

                <p>In computer programming, unit testing is a software testing method by which individual units of source code—sets of one or more computer program modules together with associated control data, usage procedures, and operating procedures—are tested to determine whether they are fit for use</p>
